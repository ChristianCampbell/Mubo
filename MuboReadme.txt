Hello!

This is the README for Mubo, a game created by Max Chambati-Woodhead and Christian Campbell. 

The blog for our progress on this project is at muboapp.wordpress.com

The file structure is all in the right order so it should just run inside xCode with no problems.

the game is inside the Creative 2015 Folder.

OpenFrameworks and Box2D libraries are required to run this game.
